A web game plan.

use LLM to geneate a sentence
save the sentence as a variable
next, ask the LLM to write the sentence using only emojis
show the user scrambled words from the sentence with some additional words thrown in
the user must click on the correct words in order to write out the sentence based on the emojis
the user has a limited amount of time to guess the original sentence 
 

The key is to provide a clear context or "domain" for the emojis to make the guessing satisfying.

Here are some domain ideas, categorized by genre and gameplay style.

### Category 1: Pop Culture & Media
*(These are great for virality and shared cultural knowledge.)*

1.  **Emoji Movie Titles / TV Shows**
    *   **Concept:** Players see a sequence of emojis and must guess the movie or TV show title.
    *   **Example:** 🦁👑 → *The Lion King*; 👧🏼🔥🎯 → *The Hunger Games*.
    *   **Twist:** Have categories like "90s Movies," "Anime," or "Netflix Originals."

2.  **Song Titles & Lyrics**
    *   **Concept:** Emojis represent a famous song title or a key line from the lyrics.
    *   **Example:** 🍌➡️👗🎉 → *Hollaback Girl* ("This shit is bananas, B-A-N-A-N-A-S"); 👶🦈 → *Baby Shark*.
    *   **Gameplay:** You could even play a short audio clip with the emojis as the hint.

3.  **Famous People & Characters**
    *   **Concept:** Guess the celebrity, historical figure, or fictional character.
    *   **Example:** 🎸🇺🇸🏛️ → Elvis Presley; 🕷️👨 → Spider-Man; 👸🇬🇧🐶👑 → Queen Elizabeth II.

### Category 2: Word & Phrase Puzzles
*(These focus on language and are highly addictive.)*

4.  **What's the Saying? (Idioms & Common Phrases)**
    *   **Concept:** The emojis visually represent a common idiom or proverb.
    *   **Example:** 🍎📚👨‍🏫 → *An apple for the teacher*; 😴🐕💤 → *Let sleeping dogs lie*; ⏰💸🧵 → *A stitch in time saves nine*.
    *   **Advantage:** Has a nearly endless supply of puzzles.

5.  **"Emoji-grams" (Pictionary-style)**
    *   **Concept:** A single, more complex word or concept is represented by emojis. This is more abstract.
    *   **Example:** 🧊❤️ → *Coldhearted*; 👁️🍯 → *Eye candy*; 🚫☀️🎬 → *Parasite* (the movie).

6.  **Compound Words**
    *   **Concept:** Two or more emojis combine to form a single compound word.
    *   **Example:** 🔥 + 🏠 = *Firehouse*; 🦇 + 👨 = *Batman*; 🌞 + 🌼 = *Sunflower*.

### Category 3: Themed & Niche Categories
*(These can build dedicated communities.)*

7.  **"Geek-ji" (Science, Tech, & Academia)**
    *   **Concept:** Emojis represent scientific terms, tech brands, or academic concepts.
    *   **Example:** ⚫🕳️ → *Black Hole*; 🍎⌚ → *Apple Watch*; 🧬🐑 → *Dolly the Sheep* (cloning).

8.  **"Brandji" (Company & Product Logos)**
    *   **Concept:** Guess the company or product from emojis that represent its logo, slogan, or product.
    *   **Example:** ✅ → *Nike*; 🍟🤴 → *Burger King*; 🐄🔔 → *Taco Bell*.

9.  **"Around the World" (Geography & Landmarks)**
    *   **Concept:** Emojis represent a country, city, or famous landmark.
    *   **Example:** 🗽🍎 → *New York City*; 🇫🇷🗼→ *Paris*; 🐪🏜️➡️👉 → *Egypt* ("Gyp-toe" - a punny one).

### Category 4: Gameplay & Mechanics-Focused Ideas
*(These ideas build a unique game structure around the core concept.)*

10. **"Emoji Chain" (Infinite Runner Style)**
    *   **Concept:** Emojis scroll horizontally across the screen. The player has to type the answer before the time runs out. The speed increases as your score gets higher.

11. **"Emoji Story" (Narrative Puzzles)**
    *   **Concept:** A longer sequence of emojis tells a simple story, summarizes a fairy tale, or depicts a historical event.
    *   **Example:** 👸💤😘🐸🤴 → *Sleeping Beauty*; 🍎🌳🐍👩‍👩‍👧‍👦➡️🏠 → *Adam and Eve*.

12. **Multiplayer "Codenames" Style**
    *   **Concept:** Two teams compete. A "spymaster" from each team gets a list of words (e.g., "Banana," "Time," "Star"). They must give a single emoji clue that connects multiple words on their team's list. Their teammates then guess.

13. **"Emoji Charades" (Live Multiplayer)**
    *   **Concept:** One player is given a word/phrase and has a limited time to construct an emoji sequence to represent it. Other players type their guesses in real-time. The guesser and creator get points.

### Tips for Execution:

*   **Difficulty Levels:** Implement an easy/medium/hard system. Easy could be direct representations (🚗 = Car), while hard could be puns and abstract concepts (👂🔥 = "Earring").
*   **Hints System:** Offer hints like "Starts with 'B'" or "It's a movie from 2015."
*   **Community Contributions:** Allow users to submit their own emoji puzzles, which can provide endless content and engagement.
*   **Clean, Simple UI:** The focus should be on the emojis. Use a large, clear font for the emoji display and a simple input box for answers.
